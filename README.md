# About this repository
I've created this project to study and learn golang and the operators framework.

## The networkpolicy-operator
The project contains a Kubernetes operator that adds some labels to all pods from namespaces configured in the custom resource.

It is developed using the [operator-framework](https://operatorframework.io/).
